I am [Andrea Gavazzi](https://github.com/andreagavazzi) an IT enthusiast and a maker. I love learning, building and programming. That's basically the reason why I'm interested in IT.
As a programmer, I enjoy bringing in the code I wrote, the obsessive attention to details I'm known for. I can truly see programming as a form of modern art. 

**Talking about me:**

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working for [CLAAS](https://www.claas.it) as Head of local IT;
- 📝 You can download my resume [here](https://github.com/andreagavazzi/Curriculum/blob/main/AndreaGavazzi_CV_IT.pdf);
- 🚀 In 2016 I created [agRobotics]() as a branding for my side projects in Robotic Science;
- 📝 I like writing software documentation;
- 🚣 I love Kayaking when the sunset is imminent and the dusk glitters in the lake.
